# 024-4216COMP-Group6

## Project Overview
The College Basketball Visualizations project aims to analyze and visualize data related to collegiate basketball tournaments. By leveraging Python's Pandas library, we explore various aspects of team performance and statistics, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of college basketball.

## Purpose
The project serves multiple purposes:
1. Analyze trends and patterns in collegiate basketball data.
2. Provide insights into team performance and statistical metrics.
3. Generate visualizations to facilitate easy interpretation of data.
4. Enable interactive exploration of different facets of college basketball tournaments.

## Prerequisites and Installation
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Hazim2024/2024-4216COMP-Group6.git
    ```
* Ensure Python is installed on your system.
* Install the required libraries (matplotlib and pandas) using pip install matplotlib pandas.
* Import the libraries
    ```sh
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    ```
* Download the cbb.csv dataset and place it in the same directory as the script.
* Run the 'main.py', and follow the on-screen instructions to select and view different visualizations.

## Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:

- **main.py**: Contains the main script where users can access all visualizations through a menu-driven interface.

- **README.md**: The main README file providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code.

- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset "cbb.csv".

- **visualizations/**: Directory containing individual branches for each team member's visualization. Each branch includes a Python script for the visualization and a README.md file providing details about the visualization's purpose and how to run it.

This structure helps users understand where to find specific components of the project and facilitates navigation within the repository. Each visualization is organized into its own directory, making it easy to locate and explore individual contributions.
